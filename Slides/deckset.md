# Closing thoughts

Server-side Swift is a lot more mature than you'd think. Yes, we're still in the early days, but that doesn't mean it's not ready for production.

Most issues are related to missing features and tools and will resolve themselves in the coming months and years.

Now is definitely the time to get involved!
